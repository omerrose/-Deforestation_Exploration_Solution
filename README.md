# Deforestation_Exploration_Solution
Deforestation Exploration Solution SQL Project
Report  into Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016.
Using the data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

I used SQL queries to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.
